## Generate Password button

Users start the process by clicking on the generate password button which runs through a series of prompt and confirm pop ups. Initially the user must choose a number between 8 -128. Numbers outside of this parameter are rejected the the user is sent back to the generate password button

## Confirm Prompts

Once users have selected an accepted password length they are given several confirm prompts to choose how to format thier password. There are 4 different global string variables that each confirm prompt corresponds to. By denying specific confirm alerts is overwriting the specific variable string with an empty string.

## Password Randomizer

At the end of the string of confirm prompts a new variable is created

var finalChoice 

This variable will then go through a password randomizer and create a randomly generated password based on the users specifications.
